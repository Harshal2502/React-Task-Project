<h1>React-Task-Project</h1><br>

As part of an evaluation for an internship application, I was given a task to make a clone of a particular website with React JS, from scratch. Along with user authentication, I had to take care of the responsiveness of the website.

I used bootstrap with react to make sure that the website is responsive and for the user authentication part, I implimented the auth0 services.
